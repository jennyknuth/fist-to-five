Fist-to-Five is a **real-time web app** that allows people to weigh-in on questions and offer opinions. 

For example, a teacher can ask "How well do you feel you understand JavaScript promises?" or simply make a statement: "The sides of an isoceles triangle have equal length," choose a scale, and allow participants to vote. The teacher can instantly determine whether to review or move on to the next topic. 

Data is stored in the cloud and any changes are rendered instantly to any device pointing to the fist-to-five url. Each user can immediately see changes made by other users.
